#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#Analysis

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 

select count(orderID)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length (orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

select count (orderID)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where Product = 'iPhone'
and length (orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

select distinct acctnum 
from BIT_DB.customers cust
join BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
on cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
where length(orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

select Product, MIN(price)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length (orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID'
limit 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

select SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, product
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

select product, location, quantity, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

select count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
from BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
join BIT_DB.customers cust
on FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
where Feb.Quantity>2
and length(orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

select Product, sum(quantity)
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location like '%Los Angeles%'
group by Product
